## Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple supervised learning algorithms to predict 30-day hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients. The goal is to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from additional interventions to reduce readmission rates.

## Methods
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Framework**: scikit-learn
- **Pipeline**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline
- Model comparison and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Feature importance analysis
